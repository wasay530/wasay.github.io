    <h4>Platform Data</h4>

    <p>
      Vapi is a voice AI platform that facilitates conversations with voicebots.
      To enable our service, we process and store certain information related to
      the calls, assistants, credentials and phone numbers as outlined below. We
      act as a data processor on behalf of our customers.
    </p>

    <h5>1. Assistants</h5>
    <p>
      When customers create AI assistants using our platform, we store the
      configuration settings, prompts, and any training data or templates used
      to build the assistant's conversational abilities. This may include sample
      phrases, knowledge base content, dialog flows, and AI model parameters.
      Assistant data is kept for as long as the customer maintains their
      assistant on our platform.
    </p>

    <h5>2. Calls</h5>
    <p>
      To provide the voice AI service, we process call audio in real-time to
      convert speech to text, apply natural language understanding and generate
      responses. Call data we collect includes:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Call parties: Phone numbers or IPs of the parties on the call</li>
      <li>
        Call metadata: Start and end times, call duration, call status
        (answered, busy, failed etc.).
      </li>
      <li>
        Call media: Recordings of the call audio, if enabled by the customer
      </li>
      <li>Call transcripts: Speech-to-text transcriptions of the call audio</li>
      <li>
        Call logs: Details on the conversation flow, AI responses and outcomes
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Call recordings, transcripts and logs may be retained to help train and
      improve the AI models, in accordance with applicable laws. Retention
      periods depend on the customer's configuration and data is deleted on
      request.
    </p>

    <h5>3. Credentials</h5>
    <p>
      To connect with third-party services and providers that enable our voice
      AI functionality, we securely store necessary credentials, such as API
      keys, access tokens, and webhook URLs. These credentials are encrypted and
      accessible only to the Vapi systems that require them to operate the
      service on the customer's behalf. Credentials are deleted upon customer
      request or when no longer needed.
    </p>

    <h5>4. Phone Numbers</h5>
    <p>
      To provide inbound and outbound calling capabilities, we provision and
      store phone numbers that are assigned to our customers. This includes
      phone number metadata like the number itself, type (local, toll-free,
      short code), provider, region, and assignment (which customer or assistant
      is assigned the number).
    </p>
